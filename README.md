## Docker

There is a Docker Container with mqtt client https://hub.docker.com/r/b2un0/dcled

```yaml
services:
    dcled:
        image: b2un0/dcled:latest
        restart: always
        container_name: dcled
        network_mode: bridge
        devices:
            - /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb
        environment:
            MQTT_HOST: "mqtt://192.168.1.2:1883"
            # MQTT_HOST: "mqtt://USERNAME@PASSWORD:192.168.1.2:1883"
            MQTT_TOPIC: "home/dcled"
```

the topic payload must be a json like this:

```json5
{
    "text": "word", // must be a string (short)
    "align": 0 // optional, positive integer padding from left side, negative integer = padding from right side, 0 = default = auto
}
```
